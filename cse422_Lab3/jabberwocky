Jabberwocky, by Lewis Carroll
   And the mome raths outgrabe.
h!
   The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun 
   The frumious Bandersnatch!"
He took his vorpal sword in hand; 
   Long time the manxome foe he sought -
So rested he by the Tumtum tree, 
   The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, 
   And burbled as it came!
   The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
   He went galumphing back.
