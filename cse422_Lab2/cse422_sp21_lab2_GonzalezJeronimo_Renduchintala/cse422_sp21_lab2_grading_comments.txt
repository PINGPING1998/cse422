Comments:

*** Writeup ***

Good writeup!

*** Code Quality ***

-3 Please don't leave commented-out fragments in the code.  Instead,
 please remove those before submitting.

-5 Unless there is a failure of a later allocation, neither module
 frees the dynamically allocated memory that the threads variable
 points to.

-2 Please avoid using hard coded numbers like 0644 and 2, and instead please always
use descriptively named const variables, enum lables, or #define symbols.

*** Compilation and Execution ***

The code compiled with no errors or warnings, and ran correctly in my tests except for:

-5 when run with 2 threads and an upper bound of 2, the Pi froze when
 the atomic module was loaded, and when the locking module was
 unloaded.
