*** Code Quality ***

(Multi-Thread): Hard coded to have 4 threads instead of array of threads and used duplicate code instead of loops to handle multiple threads [-1]
(Multi-Thread): No error checking when using setting up threads in init function [-3]
(Single-Thread): No error checking when calling kthread_run in init function [-1]
Race condition with timer created before threads so if timer expires before threads are created than wake_up_process could try to wake up null pointers and cause a crash: [-3]
