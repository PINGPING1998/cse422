2} MODULE DESIGN
We instantiated two static unsigned long variables. One for seconds and one for 
Nanoseconds. We initialized the seconds to 1, as when the timer would be
run wit default parameters, the timer would expire after 1 second. 

We loaded the module parameters with the permission parameter set to 0. This 
ensures that there is no readable or writable attribute.
