sing: sings the song Bilbo sings when setting off on his adventure
    in The Fellowship of the Ring for the inputted number of verses
dense_mm: creates and multiplies 2 NxN matrices where N is the inputted
    number      
parallel_dense_mm: creates and multiplies 2 NxN matrices where N is the inputted
    number   
sort: generates an array and sorts it

Real: the amount of actual time (according to the wall clock) 
    spent on the process
User: the amount of time the process spent in User space
Sys: the amount of time the process spend in Kernel space

time ./dense_mm 1000:
real 0m4.970s
user 0m4.954s
sys  0m0.014s

time ./parallel_dense_mm 1000:
real 0m0.447s
user 0m12.052s
sys  0m0.016s

From using the time command, it is evident that the real time
spent doing the non-parallel computaion is greater than when
parallel computation is being used. However, the time in userspace
is greater for parallel computing than it is for non-parallel computation.
The reason that the user time is greater is because the parallel program
is running mulitple threads at the same time and the user time
is the addition of all of the time spent in User space by those 
multiple threads.

./sing 1000:
real 0m0.144s
user 0m0.005s
sys  0m0.031s

The user timing was significantly smaller than the sys timing.
This means that the process spent a lot more time in the kernel 
space than in user space. However, real time was a lot larger than
both user and sys time. 

In ./dense_mm the sys time was significantly lower than the user space
and that is most likely because there is no real computation 
done in user space in ./sing while there is a significant amount
done in ./dense_mm.

Not a good clock: Clock_Realtime

Clock Realtime would not be a good clock as it measures real 
(wall-clock) time. This won't give a proper understanding of
user space time.

Good clock: Clock_Process_CPUtime_ID
This clock measures the CPU time on all threads in the process.
This will give an accurate measurement on how long the process
spent computing different things.

[trenduchintala@linuxlab003 test_programs]$ ./getres 1
resolution for realtime clock :          0.000000001

resolution for coarse realtime clock:          0.001000000

The resolution for my coarse realtime clock was far larger than the resolution for
the normal realtime clock. This means that the realtime clock is way more precise than
the coarse realtime clock.
