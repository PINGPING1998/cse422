sing: sings the song Bilbo sings when setting off on his adventure
    in The Fellowship of the Ring for the inputted number of verses
dense_mm: creates and multiplies 2 NxN matrices where N is the inputted
    number      
parallel_dense_mm: creates and multiplies 2 NxN matrices where N is the inputted
    number   
sort: generates an array and sorts it

Real: the amount of actual time (according to the wall clock) 
    spent on the process
User: the amount of time the process spent in User space
Sys: the amount of time the process spend in Kernel space

From using the time command, it is evident that the real time
spent doing the non-parallel computaion is greater than when
parallel computation is being used. However, the time in userspace
is greater for parallel computing than it is for non-parallel computation.
The reason that the user time is greater is because the parallel program
is running mulitple threads at the same time and the user time
is the addition of all of the time spent in User space by those 
multiple threads.
