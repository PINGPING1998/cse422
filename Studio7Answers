 mprotect -- it protects the memory pages containing any part of the address range in the interval. If
 the protections are violated, then the kernel generates a signal.

mprotect(0x76f9c000, 61440, PROT_NONE)  = 0

The address that is being protected is 0x76f9c000 and it is being protected for 61440 bytes. 
It also protects the memeory in such a way that it cannot be accessed at all.

read -- it reads a file from its descriptor that is passed as an argument. It readus up to "count"
bytes which are also passed into the function into the buffer. The address of the buffer is passed
in as a parameter as well.
