 mprotect -- it protects the memory pages containing any part of the address range in the interval. If
 the protections are violated, then the kernel generates a signal.

mprotect(0x76f9c000, 61440, PROT_NONE)  = 0

The address that is being protected is 0x76f9c000 and it is being protected for 61440 bytes. 
It also protects the memeory in such a way that it cannot be accessed at all.
